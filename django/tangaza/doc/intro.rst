Tangaza is a social networking service that makes use of SMS and voice to enable low-cost group communication. 

Users can create and manage their groups and invite others to join. 
After a group is formed, members can then text and send spoken updates to each other. 

Through sets of SMS-based commands users can create both public and private groups, 
giving them the flexibility to decide who can or cannot be members. After a message is sent, 
the members of the group are notified about the existence of a new message via a "flash", i.e. missed call, or a text.
