You should execute tz-restore.sh to recreate the tangaza db and bootstrap it with the needed data.

System requirements:
***********************
1. MySQL 5.0 or higher

TODO:
****
1. Create a database (the setup script assumes the database is called 'tangaza'.)
1. Edit tz-restore.sh and insert appropriate values for user, password and host.
Change the DB values if your database in 1. above is not called 'tangaza'.
tz-restore.sh will create the required tables. Some django* tables are also
created. These can be deleted in case you want to create your own tables or you
are not using django.


Whenever the database schema is changed you need to run the command below to generate 
the matching perl (.pm) file for the new db structure. Then replace the existing .pm file.

NOTE: Replace <hostname>, <user> and <password> with the appropriate values

perl -MDBIx::Class::Schema::Loader=make_schema_at,dump_to_dir:./ -e 'make_schema_at("Nokia::Tangaza::Schema", { debug => 1 }, [ "dbi:mysql:dbname=tangaza;host=<hostname>","<user>", "<password>" ])'

You also need to edit the appropriate class in models.py to reflect the change
